## Core Idea

I got the idea for this project from [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianLague) and tried to improve it.

Sebastian uses javascript and HTML to create an idea generator [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--GB9qyZJqg&ab_channel=SebastianLague). I really liked this idea, and I wanted to push the concept forward using the power of Python.
